[Setup](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/)<br>
1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/) for Windows, [git setup](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) can now be skipped with its new installer<br>
2. Install Ruby using [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/) <br>
   Install [DevKit](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) to enhance installed Ruby<br> (or error will be encountered during rake install caused by compiler missing)<br>
3. Follow the [Setup Octopress](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/) steps <br>
``` 
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
cd octopress    # If you use RVM, You'll be asked if you trust the .rvmrc file (say yes).
ruby --version  # Should report Ruby 1.9.3
gem install bundler
bundle install
rake install
``` 
[Deploy to Github pages](http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/) <br>
1. Create a [new Github repository](https://github.com/new) named with your user name: yourusername.github.com<br>
Preview the github page generated by github automatically: Repository->settings->Automatic Page Generator<br>
2. Continues following the deploying guide<br>
[Generate a github ssh key](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys) first or connection will be denied.
``` 
rake setup_github_pages
rake generate
rake deploy
``` 
check with 
``` 
git status
``` 
for octopress folder, status should be branch on source; for _deploy folder, status should be branch on master.<br>
3. Commit the source <br>
``` 
git add . 
git commit -m "first commit"
git push origin source
``` 
Now an uncustomized octopress blog can be visited through your github pages. <br>
Follow the [configuration](http://octopress.org/docs/configuring/) and [blog](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/) to start blogging.<br>
